# Template for the _International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence_ (IJIMAI)

The _International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial
Intelligence_ ([IJIMAI]) is a quarterly journal which provides an
interdisciplinary forum in which scientists and professionals can share their
research results and report new advances on artificial intelligence tools,
theory, methodologies, systems, architectures integrating multiple
technologies, problems including demonstrations of effectiveness, or tools that
use AI with interactive multimedia techniques.

[This template][repository] allows researchers to write and send papers to
IJIMAI, directly written in Typst! IJIMAI is the first journal ever to accept
contributions authored in Typst.

## Quick start

To use it in [the web app], find the `ijimai` template when creating a project.
To learn about creating a project, see [documentation][creating project].

To use it with [the CLI], run `typst init @preview/ijimai:1.0.0` in a terminal.

The project example and structure can also be found in the [`template`]
directory.

The template requires providing configuration, bibliography, and authors'
photos. Additionally, the project must include 5 required headings and a first
paragraph (at least one word):

```typ
#import "@preview/ijimai:1.0.0": *
#show: ijimai.with(
  config: toml("paper.toml"),
  read: path => read-raw(path),
  bibliography: "bibliography.bib", // or .yaml file (Hayagriva)
)

= Introduction
Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system for the sciences. It is designed
to be an alternative both to advanced tools like LaTeX and simpler tools like
Word and Google Docs.

= CRediT authorship contribution statement
// Content for this section is generated automatically (this comment can be
// removed).

= Data statement
= Declaration of conflicts of interest
= Acknowledgment
```

All the needed information is written in a [TOML] configuration file.

If you do not have the Unit OT font, you can download it from the [repository].
Once done, upload the [`UnitOT-Regular.otf`] and [`UnitOT-LightItalic.otf`]
files to your project directory in the [Typst.app][typst.app] web
application. If you are using Typst locally, install font files in your
operating system so that they are available to any program, alternatively use
`--font-path` (paired with `--ignore-system-fonts`) flag and pass the directory
with the downloaded fonts (see `typst compile --help`).

## Documentation

This section describes the usage of the template with accent on common issues.

### Short author list

The short author list is a short piece of text used in the citation box at the
bottom of the first page.

By default, the template will prioritize the `paper.short-author-list` value in
the configuration TOML file, if present. If the `short-author-list` key is
absent, the template will try to generate its value automatically. Generally
speaking, no action from authors is needed, however one can face some issues.

It will succeed if all authors have exactly two words in their `name` value:
first name and last name (i.e., surname). It will use the first letter
(grapheme cluster, to be exact) from the first name (then put `. `), and whole
last name (for each author). Then these pieces of text are joined together with
`, ` between each but last pair, last 2 names will have ` and ` between them.
Even though this is automated, **make sure** to double check the output in the
citation box to avoid any mistakes.

For example, for authors `"John Doe"` and `"Jane Smith"`, it will generate "J.
Doe" and "J. Smith", and the result will be "J. Doe and J. Smith".

It will fail with an error message ("Failed to generate short author list") if
it fails to split the name string into exactly 2 parts. This can happen either

- due to human error of having more than 1 whitespace in the string,
- or due to name naturally having more than 2 parts (or less than 2).

> [!NOTE]
> If the above description doesn't match the actual behavior for a given
> example, it might be a bug. Please, open an issue in the [repository] with
> problematic example.

This can happen when an author has prefix(es) and/or other additional parts in
their name, as is the case with "Johannes Diderik van der Waals". See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_(Dutch) and
https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/46500 for some context and more examples.

If one or more authors are affected by this, the template will give the error
and the document will not compile. To fix this, `paper.short-author-list` must
be added with correct value to the configuration file.
